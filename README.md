# Multivariate Linear Regression Python
Predicting house price from size and number of bedrooms. 

The columns from left to right indicate each house's : 
* Floor area in square feet
* Number of bedrooms
* Price in dollars 

The first 2 are our features, i.e. the attributes of the data which we feed into our model to make predictions. The last is our target, the value which we're attempting to predict.
